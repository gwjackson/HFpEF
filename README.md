Dependencies:

For now the only dependencies are; Python >= 3.13 and wxPython >= 4
(should run on Python > 3.7)

Comments / suggestions are appreciated

So; packaging not done yet! 
To use you will need to clone this repository into a directory of your choice
but soon will have a list of files and packaging (but but still learning that)
