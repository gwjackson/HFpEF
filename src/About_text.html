<p><font size="+3"<b>How to use the H<sub>2</sub>FpEF / HFpEF-ABA tool</b></font></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>The target users for this screening tool would be Primary Care doctors; Family Medicine or
general Internal Medicine.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>This application is designed to but opened on demand as pop-up or launched independently.
It is based on the H<sub>2</sub>FpHF screen from the article in <u>http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6202181/</u> Circulation
2018. The is also a citation for an article from a recent edition
in the <u>http://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2025/1000/heart-failure-preserved-ejection-fraction.html</u> AAFP
Journal where I (sadly and belatedly) discovered this very useful tool.</p>
<p>The HfPEF-ABA was subsequently developed to allow a simpler set of data elements just 3: BMI, Age,
    and presence of absense of A. Fib.  The original paper; Reddy: Nat .2024;30(8):2258-2264, and a review in
    Saguil - Am Fam Physician. 2025;112(6):696-687.  The Reddy article also has a link to an Excel file which includes
    the complete algorithm, the AAFP only lists the Log Odds calculations.  </p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>The user interface
is designed to copy the look of the screening table in the primary H2FpEF document but with an added
    column for data entry to be feed to the regression equation.  The HFpEF-ABA only requires 3 of the data
    elements, Age, BMI, A. Fib, these have a  ‡ (double dagger) icon for eacy reference.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>You may calculate the risk score using either of the 3 protocols.
	</p></li>
	<li><p>You can
        calculate the risk score using either the <b>Points</b>
	and clicking the appropriate check boxes,</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>once you have
		updated the appropriate selections then click the <b>Points
		Calculate</b> and the score will be displayed at the bottom
		of the column</p></li>
		<li><p>the graphic is
		a nomogram to interpret the risk score (see below)</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p>You can also
	calculate the risk score using the regression equation form the
	source article. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Hovering the
		caret over the data entry box will display a tool-tip that lists
		the range of values from the study data</p></li>
		<li><p>The data
		fields accept only numeric data with up to 2 decimal values, and
		can use the arrows to move the value up or down one unit</p></li>
		<li><p>Hypertension
		is not used for the regression equation as did not contribute any
		additional accuracy 
		</p></li>
		<li><p>Atrial Fib is
		a simple present of not present, defaults to <b>No A. Fib</b>, simple toggle the button to move between options</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Click on the
    <b>Regression Calculate</b> to calculate the risk score
	and will be displayed at the bottom of the column.</p></li>
    <li>And the third option is to use the <b>HFpEF-ABA</b> calculate button.  You will only need to enter the 3 data items.</li>
	<li><p>If you wish to
        reset the calculator the click the <b>Reset</b> and all
	entry options will be zeroed out.</p></li>
</ul> </p>
<p><br/>
<p>The <b>H2EpEF</b> authors suggest that a Points score of:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>&lt;= 1 would rule out HFpEF (regression score of ~&lt;=0.23)</p></li>
	<li><p>while a Points score of &gt;= 6 would suggest that the patient does have HfpEF
	(regression score of ~&gt;= 0.93)</p></li>
	<li><p>with scores of
	&gt;2 (~0.23) and &lt; 6 (~0.93) as requiring further consideration,
	testing, or referral. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Though cutoffs for the regression values were not given in the article.
        You can estimate the cutoffs for the regression score by using the cutoffs for the Point score
        and back referencing the regression value with the corresponding point score values on the nomogram.</p></li></ul>
<p>While the authors of the <b>HFpEF-ABA</b> do not define any cut-off values for their scoring system.
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>A brief report is displayed, and saved to the system ClipBoard as it may then be pasted into a separate working
    document, perhaps your EMR, to record the screening values and score(s).</p>
