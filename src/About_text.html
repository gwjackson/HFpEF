<p><font size="+3"<b>How to use the H<sub>2</sub>FpEF tool</b></font></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>The target users for this screening tool would be Primary Care doctors; Family Medicine or
general Internal Medicine.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>This application is
designed to but opened on demand as pop-up or launched independently.
It is based on the H<sub>2</sub>FpHF screen from the article in <u>http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6202181/</u> Circulation
2018. The is also a citation for an article from a recent edition
in the <u>http://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2025/1000/heart-failure-preserved-ejection-fraction.html</u> AAFP
Journal where I (sadly and belatedly) discovered this very useful
tool.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>The user interface
is designed to copy the look of the screening table in the primary
document but with an added column for data entry to be feed to the
regression equation. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>You may calculate the risk score using either or both protocols.
	</p></li>
	<li><p>You can
        calculate the risk score using either the <b>Points</b>
	and clicking the appropriate check boxes,</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>once you have
		updated the appropriate selections then click the <b>Points
		Calculate</b> and the score will be displayed at the bottom
		of the column</p></li>
		<li><p>the graphic is
		a nomogram to interpret the risk score (see below)</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p>You can also
	calculate the risk score using the regression equation form the
	source article. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Hovering the
		caret over the data entry box will display a tool-tip that lists
		the range of values from the study data</p></li>
		<li><p>The data
		fields accept only numeric data with up to 2 decimal values, and
		can use the arrows to move the value up or down one unit</p></li>
		<li><p>Hypertension
		is not used for the regression equation as did not contribute any
		additional accuracy 
		</p></li>
		<li><p>Atrial Fib is
		a simple present of not present, defaults to <b>No A. Fib</b>, simple toggle the button to move between options</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Click on the
    <b>Regressioin Calcuate</b> to calculate the risk score
	and will be displayed at the bottom of the column.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you wish to
        reset the calculator the click the <b>Reset</b> and all
	entry options will be zeroed out.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>The authors suggest
that a Points score of: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>&lt;= 1 would rule out HFpEF (regression score of ~&lt;=0.23)</p></li>
	<li><p>while a Points score of &gt;= 6 would suggest that the patient does have HfpEF
	(regression score of ~&gt;= 0.93)</p></li>
	<li><p>with scores of
	&gt;2 (~0.23) and &lt; 6 (~0.93) as requiring further consideration,
	testing, or referral. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Though cutoffs
	for the regression values were not given in the article, but I have
	estimated off the nomogram.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>A brief report is
displayed, and saved to the system ClipBoard as it may then pasted
into a separate working document, perhaps your EMR, to record the
screening values and score(s).</p>
